# Landing-Page---TOP-Project-Foundations
This project is made as part of The Odin Project: Foundations curriculum. This project should be made almost entirely if not entirely of Flexbox components. At this point, the curriculum has only covered block and inline structure, and Flexbox (No CSS Grid).

It will feature a goal image for what the web page should look like, but all HTML and CSS will be written from scratch. Therefore, while the page may end up looking visually identical, the code is likely to have many redundancies or inefficiencies. However, I intend to update this page as my understanding of web devlopment continues for my personal development.

Differences between the goal and this page may also arise if I decide to take creative liberties and veer from the goal.
